# cnl-module

Java (1.7+) Maven project, implementing a controlled natural language query interface/engine. This engine was designed as a component of a larger POC semantic search engine developed in the context of an industrial cooperation project. 

The interface translates controlled English questions into SPARQL queries, that are then evaluated over an RDF(S) triplestore (using Jena). Unit tests correspond here to integration tests.
